# Face-API.js Models

This directory should contain the model files required for face-api.js to function.

## Required Model Files

You need to download the following model files from the face-api.js GitHub repository:

1. `tiny_face_detector_model-shard1`
2. `tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest.json`
3. `face_landmark_68_model-shard1`
4. `face_landmark_68_model-weights_manifest.json`
5. `face_recognition_model-shard1`
6. `face_recognition_model-shard2` (this model is split into two files)
7. `face_recognition_model-weights_manifest.json`

## How to Download

You can download these files from:
https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/tree/master/weights

Place all the downloaded files directly in this directory (not in subdirectories).

## Important Note

The application will not work correctly without these model files. Make sure they are properly downloaded and placed in this directory.
