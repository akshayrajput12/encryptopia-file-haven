# SecureFiles - Secure File Management System Documentation

## Overview

SecureFiles is a comprehensive file management system that prioritizes security and user experience. This document provides detailed information about the system's architecture, security features, and implementation details.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern React-based frontend architecture with a Supabase backend for authentication, database, and file storage:

### Frontend Components

1. **Authentication**
   - Password-based authentication with email/password
   - Two-factor authentication support
   - Magic link authentication

2. **File Management**
   - File upload/download with encryption options
   - Folder creation and navigation
   - File sharing with permission levels
   - File metadata viewing

3. **Security Features**
   - Client-side encryption/decryption
   - Malware and threat detection
   - Input sanitization
   - Buffer overflow prevention

### Backend (Supabase)

1. **Authentication**
   - User management and session handling
   - Profile information storage

2. **Database Tables**
   - `profiles`: User profile information
   - `files`: File metadata and references
   - `file_shares`: File sharing permissions

3. **Storage Buckets**
   - `files`: For storing encrypted and unencrypted files
   - `profile-images`: For user avatars

## Security Implementation Details

### Authentication Security

1. **Password-based Authentication**
   - Passwords are never stored in plaintext
   - Supabase handles password hashing and salting
   - Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks

2. **Two-Factor Authentication**
   - Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) implementation
   - QR code generation for easy setup with authenticator apps
   - Fallback recovery codes (for production implementation)

### File Security

1. **Encryption**
   - AES-GCM encryption with 256-bit keys
   - Client-side encryption for end-to-end privacy
   - Unique encryption keys per file
   - Password-derived key option using PBKDF2

2. **Access Control**
   - Role-based permissions (read, write, admin)
   - Owner-based access restrictions
   - Granular sharing controls

3. **Threat Detection**
   - File content scanning for malware signatures
   - Detection of common attack patterns:
     - Buffer overflow attempts
     - SQL injection patterns
     - Cross-site scripting (XSS) attempts
   - File type restrictions for potentially dangerous formats
   - File size limits to prevent DoS attacks

### Data Protection

1. **Data in Transit**
   - HTTPS for all communications
   - Secure WebSocket connections for real-time updates

2. **Data at Rest**
   - Encrypted file storage
   - Database column encryption for sensitive metadata

## Database Schema

### Profiles Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  full_name TEXT,
  avatar_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  last_sign_in TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  two_factor_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
```

### Files Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE files (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  type TEXT NOT NULL,
  size INTEGER NOT NULL,
  owner_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) NOT NULL,
  path TEXT NOT NULL,
  parent_id UUID REFERENCES files(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  is_encrypted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  encryption_key TEXT,
  is_shared BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  shared_with UUID[],
  metadata JSONB
);
```

### File Shares Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE file_shares (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  file_id UUID REFERENCES files(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  shared_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) NOT NULL,
  shared_with UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) NOT NULL,
  permission TEXT CHECK (permission IN ('read', 'write', 'admin')) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Input Validation**
   - All user inputs are validated and sanitized
   - Content-type checking for uploaded files
   - Size limits to prevent abuse

2. **Error Handling**
   - Secure error handling that doesn't expose system details
   - Comprehensive error logging for security events
   - User-friendly error messages

3. **Frontend Security**
   - Protection against XSS with React's built-in escaping
   - CSRF protection via token-based authentication
   - Content Security Policy implementation

## Setting Up the Environment

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v14+
- Supabase account

### Supabase Setup
1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Create the tables as per the schema defined above
3. Set up storage buckets:
   - `files`
   - `profile-images`
4. Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies for tables and storage
5. Add your Supabase URL and anon key to the application

### Development Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Security Features**
   - Hardware security key support
   - Biometric authentication
   - Zero-knowledge proofs for enhanced privacy

2. **Additional Functionality**
   - Version control for files
   - Collaborative editing
   - Enhanced mobile support
   - Offline access

3. **Enterprise Features**
   - Organization-level access controls
   - Audit logging and compliance reporting
   - Data retention and legal hold capabilities

## Conclusion

SecureFiles demonstrates how to build a secure file management system using modern web technologies. The implementation balances security with usability, providing a responsive and intuitive interface while maintaining robust protection for user data.
